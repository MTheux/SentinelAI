DjVu ActiveX Control ImageURL Property Overflow
From DjVu.org :
"DjVu (pronounced "dï¿½jï¿½ vu") is a digital document format with advanced compression technology and high performance value.
DjVu allows for the distribution on the Internet and on DVD of very high resolution images of scanned documents,
digital documents, and photographs. DjVu viewers are available for the web browser, the desktop, and PDA devices."

vulnerability is in DjVu ActiveX Control 3.0 for Microsoft (r) Office ( DjVu_ActiveX_MSOffice.dll)
you can use heap spray to exploit this vulneability but I like to use this multiple technique ( SEH overwrite + Heap Spray )
oooo, there is also /SafeSEH OFF
other properties are also vulnerable ( Mode or maybe Page and Zoom )
