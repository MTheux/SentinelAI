HP Virtual Rooms WebHPVCInstall Control Buffer Overflow Exploit
written by e.b.
Note that I did not have time to work out some heap fragmentation issues so this code is NOT reliable...
Tested on Windows XP SP2(fully patched) English, IE6, hpvirtualrooms14.dll version 1.0.0.100
Thanks to rgod, h.d.m. and the Metasploit crew
